# Store injecting

The term of injection comes from `mobx-react` library. It is a legacy way of accessing the MobX stores across component tree. It was made because React [legacy context][context-legacy] was rather awkward to use.

We are in 2019 now and we don't need injections anymore (_kids, don't do drugs_).

## Why is it obsolete?

The main reason is that we have much better tools at our disposal now. The inject pattern is not wrong or broken in general, but is rather limited and error-prone.

In its simplest form of `inject('myStore')` _(strings, meh!)_, the wrapped component props get modified. It's easy to lost track what is coming in the component and it can be source of ugly bugs. Not even mentioning struggles in TypeScript world which were [never properly resolved](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-react/issues/256).

The other variant allows for reactive selections over the stores and to pick values the component is interested in. It can be useful if reused over multiple components, but otherwise it brings similar confusion as other variant.

```tsx
const NameDisplayer = ({ name }) => <h1>{name}</h1>

const UserNameDisplayer = inject(stores => ({
  name: stores.userStore.name,
}))(NameDisplayer)

const App = () => <UserNameDisplayer name="Is this name used? Who knows." />
```
